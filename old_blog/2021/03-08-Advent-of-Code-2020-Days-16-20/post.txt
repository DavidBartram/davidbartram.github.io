# Advent of Code 2020 Days 16-20

![advent architecture blur business]({{ "images/pexels-photo-195030.jpeg" | relative_url }})

Continuing my series of posts as I work through [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020/) at my own pace. Here are some of my thoughts and solutions.

These posts will be quite brief, just a few thoughts on each puzzle and the Python 3 code I used to solve it. All code on Github [here](https://git.io/JmAvJ). The code below is for Part 2 of each day, which often incorporates Part 1 in some way.

Day 16 - [Ticket Translation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/16)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

In this puzzle, train tickets have a set of fields (such as seat class, departure station, etc.) and each field has a set of possible integer values. Unfortunately you can't read the field names on the tickets, so you have to establish from the values which tickets are valid. And then, you have to figure out which fields are in which position on the ticket so you can finally interpret your own ticket!

The latter part - matching fields to positions - is a standard problem, [Maximum Bipartite Matching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-bipartite-matching/), and my solution below follows the same method as the examples on the linked page.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
import re


# (A) PROCESS THE INPUT

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    notes = file.read()

#identify the list of field names

field_pattern = r'([a-zA-Z ]+): ([0-9]+)-([0-9]+) or ([0-9]+)-([0-9]+)'

fields = re.findall(field_pattern, notes)

#translate the information about each field into a set of allowed values for each field
field_dict = {}

for field in fields:
    values = set()
    a = int(field[1])
    b = int(field[2])+1
    values = values.union(set(range(a,b)))

    c = int(field[3])
    d = int(field[4])+1

    values = values.union(set(range(c,d)))

    field_dict[field[0]] = values

#create a set holding all the valid values for any field
all_valid_values = set()

for field, values in field_dict.items():
    all_valid_values = all_valid_values.union(values)

#process my ticket into a list of integers
my_ticket_pattern = r'your ticket:\n(.+)'

my_ticket = re.findall(my_ticket_pattern, notes)

my_ticket =[int(x) for x in my_ticket[0].split(',') ]

#process the nearby tickets into lists of integers
tickets_pattern = r'(?:nearby tickets:)(\n(?:.+\n)+)'

tickets = re.findall(tickets_pattern, notes)[0]

tickets = re.split('\n', tickets)

tickets = [x for x in tickets if x]

tickets = [x.split(',') for x in tickets]

# (B) IDENTIFY VALID TICKETS

#determine which tickets are valid in the sense of containing only values
# which are valid for SOME field
validtickets = tickets.copy()

for ticket in tickets:
    for num in ticket:
        num = int(num)
        if num not in all_valid_values:
            validtickets.remove(ticket)

# (C) FIND MAXIMUM BIPARTITE MATCHING OF FIELD NAMES TO POSITIONS ON TICKET

#create a dictionary called 'possibility' to represent the bipartite graph
# of possible positions to fields
#keys = field names
# values = list of 0s and 1s representing which positions the field could match to
#e.g. if possibility['foo'] = [0,1,0,1,0,0,1]
# then the 'foo' field could match to position 1, 3 or 6
#initialise such that any field could match to any position, so all values are lists of 1s
#later the matchings which aren't possible will be set to zero
w=len(validtickets[0])
possibility = {y:[1 for x in range(w)] for y in field_dict}

#set impossible matchings to have value zero in the possibility dictionary
for ticket in validtickets:
    for field in field_dict:
        for j, x in enumerate(ticket):
            x = int(x)
            if x not in field_dict[field]:
                possibility[field][j] = 0
                #if the value in this position on any valid ticket is not valid
                #for this field
                #then the match is not possible


def match(possibility,field, matchR, seen):
    #takes the possibility dictionary,
    #a particular field,
    #the current assignment of fields to positions,
    #and a list to keep track of which positions have been visited
    #if the conditions are met, assigns the field to a particular position in matchR
    #and returns True
    #otherwise returns False


    #iterate over the possible positions the field could be assigned to
    for j in range(len(possibility)): 
  
        # If the matching of the field to this position is possible 
        # and position j has not yet been visited
        if possibility[field][j] and seen[j] == False: 
                  
            # Mark position j as visited
            seen[j] = True 
  
            #If position j is not currently assigned to a field (matchR[j] == -1)
            # OR the previously assigned field for position j (matchR[j])
            #has an alternate position available
            # since position j is marked as visited in the above line,
            #the recursive call will not visit position j again
            if matchR[j] == -1 or match(possibility,matchR[j], matchR, seen): 
                matchR[j] = field #assign position j to the field we are considering
                return True

    return False

def maxmatch(possibility, field_dict): 
    # matchR is a list of fields assigned to each position
    # here we use a convention where if matchR[k] == -1,
    #then position k has not yet been assigned to a field
    matchR = [-1] * len(possibility) #initialise with no positions assigned to fields
    
    #iterate over fields
    for field in field_dict: 
        #before considering a new field, reset the visited positions
        seen = [False] * len(possibility)
        match(possibility, field, matchR, seen)

    return matchR

matchR = maxmatch(possibility, field_dict)

#(D) CALCULATE PUZZLE SOLUTION

#build up the product of values in my ticket for fields beginning with 'departure',
# as required to get the puzzle solution
product = 1

for i,field in enumerate(matchR):
    if field.startswith('departure'):
        product = product*my_ticket[i]

print(product)
```

Day 17 - [Conway Cubes](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/17)
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

Conway's Game of Life in 4 dimensions. My solution below is rather inefficient, but for 4 dimensions it runs in a reasonable time. Justin Le's [magnificent interactive blog article](https://blog.jle.im/entry/degenerate-hyper-dimensional-game-of-life.html) on this puzzle explains how the degenerate starting conditions of this puzzle (only one 2D "slice" of hypercubes can possibly be occupied at the start) can be used to optimise the solution such that the 10-dimensional case becomes achievable on a laptop. Go read the article, it's really excellent stuff.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
from copy import deepcopy
from itertools import product

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    initial = file.read().replace('#','1').replace('.','0').splitlines()
    initial = [list(line) for line in initial]
    initial = [list(map(int, line)) for line in initial]

def neighbours(i,j,k,l):
    #find the coordinates of the neighbouring hypercubes to the given coordinates

    #use a Cartesian product to generate all the possible "steps"
    #to a neighbouring hypercube
    steps = list(product([-1,0,1], repeat=4))
    
    #a hypercube is not its own neighbour
    steps.remove((0,0,0,0))
        
    neighbours = []
        
    for (a,b,c,d) in steps:
        w,z,y,x = i+a, j+b, k+c, l+d
        neighbours.append((w,z,y,x))
    
    return neighbours

def neighdict(grid):
    #build a dictionary holding the coords of the neighbours of each hypercube
    dict_ = {}
    for coords in grid:
        i,j,k,l = coords
        dict_[i,j,k,l] = neighbours(i,j,k,l)
    return dict_

def advance(grid,nbdict):
    #apply the game of life rules to advance the 4D grid one generation
    newgrid = deepcopy(grid)

    for (i,j,k,l) in grid:
            nbs = nbdict[(i,j,k,l)]
            occ = 0

            for (w,x,y,z) in nbs:
                if grid.get((w,x,y,z),0) == 1:
                    occ += 1
            
            if grid.get((i,j,k,l),0) == 0 and occ == 3:
                newgrid[(i,j,k,l)]= 1
            
            if grid.get((i,j,k,l),0) == 1 and occ != 3 and occ != 2:
                newgrid[(i,j,k,l)] = 0
    
    return newgrid

print(initial)

n = 6 #6 steps required by puzzle

w=len(initial[0])+n+1
h=len(initial)+n+1
d=n+1
grid = {(i,j,k,l):0 for i in range(-w,w) for j in range(-h,h) for k in range(-d,d) for l in range(-d,d)}

for i, row in enumerate(initial):
    for j, num in enumerate(row):
        grid[(i,j,0,0)] = num


nbdict = neighdict(grid)

for i in range(n):
    newgrid = advance(grid,nbdict)
    grid = newgrid

count=0
for coords, val in grid.items():
    if val == 1:
        count += 1

print(count)
```

Day 18 - [Operation Order](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

The puzzle here is to parse and evaluate expressions in an unfamiliar version of arithmetic where addition takes precedence over multiplication. Expressions in parentheses still have to be evaluated first, as in familiar arithmetic.

I will admit to having been rather lazy in the solution below. I haven't written my own parser, I've let the pyparsing library do the job for me. I also use Python's inbuilt arithmetic (via `eval`) to do the actual addition and multiplication.

The `parse` function is, shall we say, a little quirky. I preferred the string representation of the output from the pyparsing parseString method to the output object itself. The string representation looks like a list of lists, but of course is a string. Rather than wrangle the output object to do what I want - which I'm certain is possible - I just used `eval` to turn the string into the list that it resembles.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
from pyparsing import *

integer = pyparsing_common.integer

arith_expr = infixNotation(
    integer,
    [
        ('+',2,opAssoc.LEFT),
        ('*',2,opAssoc.LEFT)
    ]
)

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    lines = file.readlines()

def parse(string):
    return eval(str(arith_expr.parseString(string)))

def apply(op,val1,val2):
    x = str(val1) + op + str(val2)
    return str(eval(x))


def evaluate(exp):
    val_stack = []
    op_stack = []

    for x in exp:
        
        if type(x) is str:
            if x in {'+','*'}:
                op_stack.append(x)

        elif type(x) is list:
            val_stack.append(evaluate(x))

        else:
            val_stack.append(str(x))

    for op in op_stack:
        new_vals = []
        new_vals.append(apply(op,val_stack[0],val_stack[1]))
        new_vals += val_stack[2:]
        val_stack = new_vals

    return val_stack[0]

summ = 0

for line in lines:
    exp = parse(line)
    y = int(evaluate(exp))
    #print(y)
    summ = summ + y

print(summ)
```

Day 19 - [Monster Messages](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/19)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

Here we have to test strings such as bbabbbbaabaabba against rule 0 from a set of rules like the below:

The _rules for valid messages_ (the top part of your puzzle input) are numbered and build upon each other. For example:

0: 1 2
1: "a"
2: 1 3 | 3 1
3: "b"

Some rules, like `3: "b"`, simply match a single character (in this case, `b`).

The remaining rules list the sub-rules that must be followed; for example, the rule `0: 1 2` means that to match rule `0`, the text being checked must match rule `1`, and the text after the part that matched rule `1` must then match rule `2`.

Some of the rules have multiple lists of sub-rules separated by a pipe (`|`). This means that _at least one_ list of sub-rules must match. (The ones that match might be different each time the rule is encountered.) For example, the rule `2: 1 3 | 3 1` means that to match rule `2`, the text being checked must match rule `1` followed by rule `3` _or_ it must match rule `3` followed by rule `1`.

I knew it would be possible to recursively build a regex to then match to each string, but my feeling was that if I have to make the regex recursively, I might as well actually apply the rules recursively. This was not as easy as I expected. But, taking some inspiration from the approach of [Marco Bonelli](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/tree/master/2020), I was eventually able to put something together.

The advantage of this approach over regex is that in part 2, when the rules are altered to include loops, this solution can be run unaltered on the new input, and works fine. With regex a bit of fancy footwork would be required, as the required expression to match is no longer regular.

The workhorse in this solution is the recursive function `check(word, rules, rule_number=0)` which takes a word (e.g. the string bbabbbbaabaabba) and checks it against rule 0 by default. When called, check returns a list containing the remaining part(s) of the string to check. This list can have multiple entries due to the OR statements inside some of the rules - you might be able to validate 5 characters of a string by following one branch, but only 3 characters if you go along a different branch. If there's any way through the tree of rules to validating the entire word, you'll find the empty string `''` in the final output of `check`. If the empty string isn't in the output, then the word is not valid according to rule zero.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
import re

#Process the input into rules and words
with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    pattern = r'([0-9]+):(.+)'
    rules = {int(re.findall(pattern,x)[0][0]) : re.findall(pattern,x)[0][1]  for x in file.readlines() if re.match(pattern,x) }

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    pattern = r'[a-z]+'
    words = [x.replace('\n','') for x in file.readlines() if re.match(pattern,x)]

#tidy up the rules into a more usable format, so that each rule is:
#a list containing a single character e.g. ['a']  OR
#a list of rule numbers e.g. [3,5,2]
#a list of lists of rule numbers, if the original rule contained a "|" meaning OR
#e.g. [[7,2,33], [6,7,10]]
newrules = rules.copy()

for key, val in rules.items():
    if re.match(r' "[a-z]"', val):
        newrules[key] = val.replace("\"", "").replace(" ", "")
    
    else:
        if "|" in val:
            newval = val.split("|")
            newval = [[int(y) for y in x.split()] for x in newval]
        else:
            newval = [[int(y) for y in val.split()]]
        
        newrules[key] = newval

rules = newrules

#recursive function to check a word against rule 0
def check(word, rules, rule_number=0):

    #if you're past the end of the word, return the empty list
    if word == '':
        return [] 

    #look up the rule in the rules dict
    rule = rules[rule_number]

    #if the rule is a string, it will be one character
    #this character should be matched to the first character of the word
    #then output a list containing the rest of the word if successful
    #or the empty list if unsuccessful
    if isinstance(rule,str):

        if word[0] == rule:
            return [word[1:]]
        else:
            return []

    matches = []

    #rules containing a single rule list or two options are both handled here
    for option in rule:
        #begin with the entire word
        opt_matches = [word] 

        for subrule_number in option: 
            new_matches = []
            for wd in opt_matches:
                #recursive function call
                new_matches += check(wd, rules, subrule_number)
            
            opt_matches = new_matches
        
        matches += opt_matches
    
    return matches

count = 0

for word in words:
    if '' in check(word,rules):
        count += 1

print(count)
```

Day 20 - [Jurassic Jigsaw](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/20)
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

The goal here can be stated simply enough - piece together a square ASCII image by matching the edges of a set of tiles. Each tile can be used only once, but it may need to be rotated or flipped before it will slot into place. The puzzle input does provide one major gift: if two edges match, then those two edges are matched in the final puzzle.

Once the tiles are placed together, strip the edges from each tile and search the resulting ASCII image for a particular pattern of hashes called a sea monster. The final result is the number of hashes in the image which are NOT part of any sea monster.

This was a long process with multiple stages and a plethora of helper functions. The error that caused the most confusion was the fact that I forgot to forbid a tile to be matched to a flipped version of itself, and so I was filling up the image without using all the tiles, using some tiles multiple times.

The solution below is a brute force solution and makes no bones about it!

### Python Code
```python
