# Doubting Tau - a question of π

![ball black bubble colorful](_soap-bubble-colorful-ball-soapy-water.jpg)

I've spent a lot of my life talking about _π_. Seven years as a maths educator will do that to a person.

But I have a dark secret - every time I taught a class of students about everyone's favourite transcendental number, I felt a twinge of pain. Because, deep down, I suspected that _π_ wasn't a very sensible constant to work with.

Defining π
----------

There are various mathematical formulae that evaluate to _π._ That said, most people would agree that a good _definition_ of _π_ would be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. We could use the formula below as a fundamental definition of _π_ , where C is the circumference of a circle and d is the diameter.

**C = π d**

Already we run into a question - does this embody a relation between properties that are fundamental to a circle?

Circumference is not a particularly unique property of a circle, it's just a special name for the property we call perimeter. Every shape has a perimeter, that's nothing special. But it seems a reasonable property to want to calculate.

Diameter, however, is on slightly shaky ground. Every circle has a fixed diameter, it is true, but the circle isn't the only 2D shape that has the property of having a [constant width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_of_constant_width) regardless of orientation. So you can define a "diameter" for many kinds of shape, such as the [Reuleaux triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuleaux_triangle).

This Reuleaux triangle is not a circle, but it does have a constant width, regardless of how it rotates. This is shown by the shape always touching all 4 sides of the square.

Such shapes of constant width will crop up again later in this post.

A circle is the only shape defined by a radius. A circle is a set of points which lie an equal distance from a given point. The point is the centre, the distance is the radius.

So maybe **C = 2π r** , where r is the radius, makes more sense as a fundamental equation.

Enter τ
-------

If we accept the previous argument that the relationship between C and r is the crucial relationship, why should we use **π** at all? The proper constant, based on that argument, would be 2π.

If history had gone differently, we might have used a constant twice as big as π. Some mathematicians have [argued](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto) that this would be a better approach. They call their alternative circle constant by the name τ (Greek letter "tau").

**τ = 2π**

**C = τ r**

Twice as Good: The Benefits of Tau
----------------------------------

The expression 2π crops up all over the place in mathematics. It's the value of a full turn in the radian angle measure that is fundamental to trigonometry. 360 degrees is equivalent to 2π radians. So π is half a turn, the equivalent of 180 degrees.

If we used τ instead, a full turn would be τ radians. Half a turn would be half of τ. Neat, isn't it? The diagram below shows angles in radians in terms of τ , in all their intuitive neatness.

Examples of special angles in terms of τ

And various other formulae, such as the Gaussian integrals so beloved of physicists and statisticians alike, would also have an unsightly 2π replaced by a clean τ. Mathematics is absolutely full of 2π , from Fourier transforms to Cauchy's residue theorem.

Area - An Illusory Drawback
---------------------------

But some of you will be wondering about area. **A = π r^2^** , right? Won't that look ugly with τ ?

**A = ½ τ r^2^**

Doesn't look so hot. But even this actually has its advantages.

Because of basic rules of calculus, this kind of formula is common across applied mathematics:

**Kinetic energy**

**KE = ½ m v^2^**

where m=mass, v = speed

**Potential energy stored in a spring**

**PE = ½ k x^2^**

where k=spring constant, x=extension of the spring

**Distance fallen in a constant gravitational field**

**s = ½ g t^2^**

where g=acceleration due to gravity, t=time

Bringing the circle area into the fold makes it easier to see the deep connections between different areas of maths via calculus.

Volume - Archimedes' Cylinder
-----------------------------

The volume of a sphere has the charming formula, where r is the radius of the sphere:

**V = (4/3) π r^3^**

This isn't a particularly pleasant-looking thing. Does τ improve matters? 2⁄3

**V = 2⁄3 τ r^3^**

At first glance this doesn't look any nicer. The fraction at the front hasn't gone away.

But there is an insight to be gleaned from this way of writing it. **τ r^3^** is the volume of a cylinder with radius r and height 2r. This cylinder would completely enclose the sphere, just touching it, as shown below:

A sphere inside the smallest cylinder that could enclose it.

To verify this:

The base of the cylinder has area **½ τ r^2^** (equivalent to the familiar **π r^2^** ).

Multiply the area of the base by the height **½ τ r^2^** x 2**r** = **τ r^3^**

So what this formula shows, very intuitively, is that every sphere has a volume equal to two-thirds of the volume of a cylinder that just encloses it! This [amazing result](https://www.datagenetics.com/blog/july32014/index.html) was first discovered by Archimedes, and his discovery is showcased very clearly in a notation that uses τ instead of π.

Barbier's Theorem - Reason to Doubt
-----------------------------------

So far I've been summarising and agreeing with the [Tau Manifesto](https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto). τ makes numerous formulae look nicer, and makes the area formula (which looks worse) actually fit into its mathematical niche more obviously.

But there is a problem here, and it comes back to those [shapes of constant width](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_of_constant_width) I was talking about earlier.

Every shape of constant width obeys [Barbier's theorem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbier%27s_theorem) Namely, that the perimeter of such shapes is always equal to π multiplied by the width, or diameter.

Remember that circumference is just a fancy word for "perimeter", used for the perimeter of a circle in particular. Turns out a circle is just an _example_ of a shape of constant diameter, and the formula for circumference is just a special case of Barbier's theorem.

**P = π d**

where P is the perimeter of any shape with a constant width (or diameter) **d**.

This suggests that a diameter actually is a more fundamental property than a radius. Lots of shapes have a constant diameter, only one has a constant radius. We can't use **P = 2π r** or **P = τ r** because there is no "radius" for, say, a Reuleaux polygon. There's no constant distance from the centre to the edge of the shape.

Sure, we could arbitrarily define **r** as equal to half the diameter, but that's just playing notational games.

There's something here which suggests that a constant based on the diameter might have a broader applicability that a constant based on the radius. This is definitely a point in favour of our familiar friend π.

Confused Conclusion
-------------------

Thinking about Barbier's theorem suggests that the relationship between diameter and perimeter is more fundamental than the one between radius and perimeter. That gives primacy to π as the constant of choice. But then you have to face a world where a full turn is 2π radians and the area formula doesn't fit as neatly with its mathematical bedfellows.

The world we've all lived in since childhood, but a world that could be different.

To tau or not to tau, that is the question.
