    # Advent of Code 2020 Days 11-15

![advent architecture blur business](/images/pexels-photo-195030.jpeg)

Continuing my series of posts as I work through [Advent of Code 2020](http://adventofcode.com/2020/) at my own pace. Here are some of my thoughts and solutions.

These posts will be quite brief, just a few thoughts on each puzzle and the Python 3 code I used to solve it. All code on Github [here](https://git.io/JmAvJ). The code below is for Part 2 of each day, which often incorporates Part 1 in some way.

Day 11 - [Seating System](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11)
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

The puzzle asks you to implement a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) , not at all dissimilar to [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). Some of the cells are fixed and don't affect how other cells update - in Part 2, you need to look _past_ these cells when determining what counts as a neighbouring cell.

I tried this a couple of ways, with my preferred method shown below. It involves a number of functions:

`ray` is a recursive function follows a particular direction from the specified cell, ignoring the fixed cells, to find the next non-fixed cell in that direction.

`nbs` uses ray to produce a list of all the cells which are neighbours of the given cell, by the appropriate definition of "neighbour"

`nbdict` populates a dictionary where the keys are the coordinates of every cell in the grid and the corresponding value is a list of the coordinates of all the neighbouring cells, by the appropriate definition of "neighbouring".

The function `advance` moves the cellular automaton ahead one generation.

The function `findstability` repeatedly advances the cellular automaton, until it finds a fixed point where the layout does not change.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
from copy import deepcopy

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    initial = file.read().splitlines()
    initial = [list(line) for line in initial]


def ray(i,j,k,l, grid):
    cols = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)

    y,x = i+k, j+l

    if 0<=y<rows and 0<=x<cols:
        if grid[y][x] != '.':
            return (y,x)
        elif 0<=y+k<rows and 0<=x+l<cols:
            return ray(y,x,k,l,grid)
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False

def nbs(i,j, grid):

    steps = [(-1,-1), (-1,0), (-1,+1), (0,-1), (0,+1), (+1,-1), (+1,0), (+1,+1)]
        
    nbs = []
        
    for (k,l) in steps:
        if ray(i,j,k,l,grid):
            nbs.append(ray(i,j,k,l,grid))
    
    return nbs

def nbdict(grid):
    dict_ = {}
    cols = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            dict_[i,j] = nbs(i,j,grid)
    return dict_

def advance(grid,nbdict):
    cols = len(grid[0])
    rows = len(grid)
    newgrid = deepcopy(grid)

    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):

            nbs = nbdict[i,j]
            occ = 0

            for y,x in nbs:
                if grid[y][x] == '#':
                    occ += 1
            
            if grid[i][j] == 'L' and occ == 0:
                newgrid[i][j] = '#'
            
            if grid[i][j] == '#' and occ >= 4:
                newgrid[i][j] = 'L'
    
    return newgrid

def findstability(grid, nbdict):
    oldgrid = grid
    while True:
        newgrid = advance(oldgrid, nbdict)
        if newgrid == oldgrid:
            count = 0
            for row in newgrid:
                count += row.count('#')
            return count
        else:
            oldgrid = newgrid

nbdict = nbdict(initial)

output = findstability(initial, nbdict)

print(output)
```

Day 12 - [Rain Risk](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12)
----------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

This is some good old fashioned discrete modelling of motion on a coordinate grid, the kind of thing that was bread and butter for me studying computational physics....a long time ago. The goal is to interpret a list of instructions for the movement of a ship and a waypoint that determines the ship's forward heading, and determine the final location of the ship. The answer is the [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) [distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) of the ship from its original location after all the instructions have been followed.

My use of trigonometric functions (sine and cosine) is a bit lazy here, as the only rotations are by multiples of 90 degrees, which can be calculated without resorting to trig. But I've always loved a good rotation matrix, so it was the natural approach for me.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
import re
from math import radians, sin, cos

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    cmds = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in file]

heading = 'E'

bearings = {'N':{'dx':0,'dy':1}, 'S':{'dx':0,'dy':-1}, 'E':{'dx':1,'dy':0}, 'W':{'dx':-1,'dy':0}}

def rotation(wp, arg):
    c = int(cos(radians(arg))) #safe to cast to int as arg is always an element of {-270,-180,-90,90,180,270}
    s = int(sin(radians(arg))) #safe to cast to int as arg is always an element of {-270,-180,-90,90,180,270}
    wp['x'], wp['y'] = c*wp['x'] - s*wp['y'] , s*wp['x'] + c*wp['y']

newbearings = ['N','E','S','W']

ship = {'x':0, 'y':0}

wp = {'x':10,'y':1}

for cmd in cmds:
    m = re.match(r'(\w)(\d+)',cmd)
    op = m.group(1)
    arg = int(m.group(2))

    if op == 'F':
            ship['x'] += arg*wp['x']
            ship['y'] += arg*wp['y']

    if op in bearings:
        dx, dy = bearings[op]['dx'] , bearings[op]['dy']
        wp['x'] += arg*dx
        wp['y'] += arg*dy
    
    if op == 'L':
        rotation(wp,arg)
    
    if op == 'R':
        rotation(wp,-1*arg)

print((ship['x'],ship['y'],heading))

print(abs(ship['x'])+abs(ship['y']))
```

Day 13 - [Shuttle Search](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/13)
---------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

We have a problem based on the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem) of modular arithmetic.

The puzzle here revolves around a set of buses that each appear every `k` minutes (the period `k`). The goal is to find a time `t` such that bus 0 with period `k0` arrives at time `t` , bus 1 with period `k1` arrives at time `t+1`, bus 2 with period `` k`2` `` arrives at time `t+2` and so on.

My first attempt was a brute force solution that stood no hope of finding an answer for t higher than a hundred trillion in a reasonable timescale. Since I didn't initially know of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, I didn't apply it in my code, but I did find a way to speed up the search.

Let's say you've found a time `t1` where only the first two buses (periods `k0`, `k1`) have the desired offsets. You can ensure that those offsets remain as they are by incrementing `t` by the lowest common multiple (LCM) of `k0` and `k1`. Once you find `t2`, you can start incrementing t by the LCM of `k0`, `k1` and `k2`.

And so on, you can keep increasing the increment you advance t by as you get more and more of the buses to slot into the offsets you want. This speeds the search up to the point where you can find `t` (which for me was 939490236001473) in a sensible timescale.

### Python Code
```python
import sys
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    notes = [line.rstrip('\n').split(",") for line in file]

buses = notes[1]

offsets = {}
buslist = []

for bus in buses:
    if bus != 'x':
        offsets[int(bus)] = buses.index(bus) % int(bus) #the modulus is really helpful if int(bus) < buses.index(bus)
        buslist.append(int(bus))

def find(k,i,increment):
    if k >= len(buslist):
        return i

    while True:
            target = buslist[k] - offsets[buslist[k]]

            if i % buslist[k] == target:
                new_inc = lcm(increment,buslist[k])
                return find(k+1,i,new_inc)
                
            else:
                i = i + increment
    
print(find(1,buslist[0],buslist[0])) 
```   

Day 14 - [Docking Data](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/14)
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

Part 2 is a fun problem involving a bitmask and a memory address decoder. The memory address to be written to is represented by a 36-bit binary address. This address can contain floating bits represented by the character X, which can each be either 0 or 1. The solution needs to write the value to all of the various memory addresses produced by setting each X to either 0 or 1. In my solution these permutations are all found by the recursive function `keyversions`.

### Python Code
```python
import sys

with open(sys.argv[1]) as file:
    lines = [line.rstrip('\n').split() for line in file]

mask = ''

mem = {}  

def keyversions(keylist,value):
    if 'X' not in keylist:
        key = ''.join(keylist)
        mem[key] = value
    else:
        keycopy = keylist.copy()
        for i,char in enumerate(keylist):
            if char == 'X':
                keycopy[i] = '0'
                keyversions(keycopy,value)
                keycopy[i] = '1'
                keyversions(keycopy,value)

for line in lines:
    if line[0].startswith('mask'):
        mask = line[2]
    else:
        key = line[0].replace('mem[','').replace(']','')
        key = format(int(key),'036b')
        keylist = []

        for i, x in enumerate(key):
            if mask[i] == '0':
                keylist.append(x)
            elif mask[i] == '1':
                keylist.append('1')
            elif mask[i] == 'X':
                keylist.append('X')

        value = int(line[2])

        keyversions(keylist,value)


sum = 0

for key,val in mem.items():
    sum += val

print(sum)
```

Day 15 - [Rambunctious Recitation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/15)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Thoughts

The goal here is to model a seemingly simple game:

In this game, the players take turns saying _numbers_. They begin by taking turns reading from a list of _starting numbers_ (your puzzle input). Then, each turn consists of considering the _most recently spoken number_:

*   If that was the _first_ time the number has been spoken, the current player says _`0`_.
*   Otherwise, the number had been spoken before; the current player announces _how many turns apart_ the number is from when it was previously spoken.

In Part 1, the goal was to predict the 2020th number spoken. In Part 2, the rules didn't change, but the goal was to predict the 30 millionth number spoken - i.e. to optimise your code from Part 1. My dictionary-based solution to Part 1 was far too slow to reach a solution in sensible times.

It turns out it's much more efficient to initialise a huge list of zeroes. Rather than store the turns sequentially, the list index is the number spoken, and the list value is the last turn that this number was spoken.

So the statement `past[57] == 13` would mean that the number 57 was last spoken in turn 13.

`past[57] == 0` would mean that 57 has never been spoken before, because `past` was initialised with every value as zero.

### Python Code
```python
def play(game,turns):
    past = [0]*turns
    x = game[-1] #when the game begins, this is the most recent number to consider
    i = 1 #this is the turn counter

    #enter the initial numbers (the list "game") into the "past" list
    while i < len(game):
        past[game[i-1]] = i
        i += 1
    
    #take the last number spoken, x, and update it to the next number spoken.
    #while ensuring that past[x] equals the last turn that the number x was spoken.
    while i < turns:
        j = past[x]
